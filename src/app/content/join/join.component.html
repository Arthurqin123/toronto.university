    ## Concept

    ### Domain as Brand

    Instead of domains regulated by bureaucrats such as .ca or .edu, toronto.university can stay free and true to its
    name.

    ### Web as App

    Instead of applications in walled gardens such as the App Store or the Google Play Store, we utilize the latest
    technologies to build a web app free of installation. This saves data, processing power, and battery life. From IE
    10 to iPhone X, all you need is Internet!

    ### Design as Feature

    Instead of reworking UI at the cost of speed and functionality, we focus on designs that make common actions more
    intuitive and elegant.
